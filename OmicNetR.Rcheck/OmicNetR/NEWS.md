# OmicNetR 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
* Implements Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) for RNA-seq and Metabolomics integration.
* Includes `align_omics()` for sample synchronization between datasets.
* Provides `omic_scca()` to fit sparse partial least squares models in canonical mode.
* Features `plot_bipartite_network()` for visualizing interactions using `igraph`.
* Features `plot_pathway_circle()` for Base-R radial visualization of feature importance.
* Added synthetic data generation via `generate_dummy_omics()`.
