Description: Implements Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) to identify 
    shared variation between transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics datasets. [cite: 2]
    Provides specialized visualization tools, including bipartite weight networks 
    and circular pathway plots, to facilitate biological interpretation of 
    integrated multi-omics results. [cite: 3]
