Description: Implements Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) to identify
    shared variation between transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics datasets.
    Provides specialized visualization tools, including bipartite weight networks
    and circular pathway plots, to facilitate biological interpretation of
    integrated multi-omics results.
